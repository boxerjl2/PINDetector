Simple, low-cost X-ray/gamma-ray detector based on PIN photodiode

A silicon PIN diode (in this case an inexpensive off-the-shelf device designed for infrared optoelectronics), accompanied with appropriate electronics, can detect charged particle and energetic photon (X-ray or gamma-ray) impacts on the diode, allowing for basic qualitative ionising radiation counting (for educational use, for example)
with very simple, low-cost electronics.

This removes the traditional need for expensive, difficult to obtain and fragile Geiger-Muller tubes or scintillation detectors, and the need for their associated high-voltage power supplies, for ionising-radiation detection or experimentation in a low-budget educational or hobbyist context.

For this device to operate correctly, the PIN photodiode must be in the dark, with all ambient visible and infrared light excluded from the photodiode. Since the sensitive JFET input stage is also quite sensitive to electromagnetic interference, an opaque metal box is probably the best bet for optical and electromagnetic shielding. The metal box should be connected to the DC ground.

A thin "window" made from a layer or two of black electrical tape covering a hole in the metal box next to the PIN diode may be used to allow ionising radiation to pass into the detector with minimal attenuation or energy deposition whilst still excluding visible light from the detector and keeping the box "light-tight".

Power can be supplied from a 9 volt battery, for example.
